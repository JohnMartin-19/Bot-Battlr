# Bot-Battlr
This is a project in Phase-2. The project was basically testing the depth and understanding of React's props, state, events, and Hooks. THe requirements include:
    As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.


So far i have done:
    *Data fetching and rendering it on the DOM
    *Handling state events
    *Handling Deleting through DELETE method
    *Realising items from the state
